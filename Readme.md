<h1>Welcome to my development environment!</h1>
<p>To be honest, there isn't much here outside of setting up a development folder-file system in case my main computer kicks the bucket. That way my workflow, cheatsheets, useful-websites-that-I-couldn't-care-to-remember, home/Documents folder, and not to mention my sanity, are all still around.</p>

<h2>Notable files</h2>
<ul>
    <li>.bashrc-dev: This is the init file to enable all dev based commands used in this repository.</li>
    <li>.bashrc-*: These are specific files to categorize the specific files where needed.</li>
    <li>install_dev: This is a one-time install file that is only needed when transitioning to a new install</li>
<ul>
